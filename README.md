# SwissKnife - Scuffed but working

A paper based plugin dedicated to patching illegal items and some exploits that players have encountered on the Egirls Nation server... It's scuffed, but it works.  

The plugin was made just for one server which is Egirls Nation, you can use it on other servers, but some features will most probably not work correctly.  
  
Pull requests are welcome!  

## Disclaimer
  
If someone will want to use it on their server I or any of the contributors don't take responsibility for broken servers, dead SDD drives, thermonuclear war, or you loosing your sleep because it didn't work and you had to fix it.  

Please do some research, if you have any concerns about features included in this plugin before using it!  
YOU are choosing to make these modifications to your server, and if you point the finger at us for messing up your server, we will laugh at you.  

Thank you.
